**TODAY'S GOAL**: Today we are going to make a website that tells everyone about what we think are the **BEST** movies of all time using Bootstrap to help with design.

GOALS FOR TODAY
---------------
Today we are going to use Bootstrap to add elegant designs to our webpages. To complete this website, you should do the following:
1. Give your page a nice title using a header tag.
2. Connect Bootstrap to your website using the starter code [from Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/).  
How to add CSS from Bootstrap (make sure it is in the *head*):

How to add JavaScript from Bootstrap (make sure it's at the *end* of the body!):

3. Upload some images of your favorite movies (Ashton will tell you it's Black Panther and Hammy will tell you it's Avengers: Endgame)
4. We are going to store these images in cards. You can find the card documentation [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/card/). Add a card for **each** movie you have added (e.g. if you have 5 movies, you should have 5 cards).

5. Update the cards so they render the images and have text that gives the name of the movie and explains why you like it so much. If you do this correctly, you should have 5 cards that show each of your favorite movies.
6. Add **at least** one other Bootstrap component. I like navigation bars. You can add a navigation bar by [openning this link](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/navbar/) and doing the following:

7. **BONUS**: Add more Bootstrap components to add some extra style to your page.
8. **DOUBLE BONUS**: Add your own CSS rules to get some customized styles!
